#Ruby Mini Projects

The four projects in this repo were completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. They are intended to be short and sweet projects that test my Ruby skills so far and help me cement what I've learned. 

The projects are: Caesar Cipher, Stock Picker, Bubble Sort, and Sub Strings.

UPDATE SEP 8 2022:

I've finished all four projects, and I largely enjoyed each of them. The most difficult project, by far, was stock picker. I simply couldn't wrap my head around alternate solutions besides the one I came up with, and as a few helpful people on the TOP Discord Server pointed out to me, using that many loops isn't ideal.

Bubble sort was the easiest, followed by substrings, with caesar cipher being the 2nd-hardest. I learned a lot from these projects, and I feel like I have a much stronger command over Ruby as a language than I did before taking them on. My code isn't the cleanest, but I'm proud of my solutions.

Thanks to TOP, and onward to Object Oriented Programming!
