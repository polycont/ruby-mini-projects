#Ruby Mini Projects

The four projects in this repo were completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. They are intended to be short and sweet projects that test my Ruby skills so far and help me cement what I've learned. 

The projects are: Caesar Cipher, Stock Picker, Bubble Sort, and Sub Strings.
